Private repo for the inner circle of mad h@XX0rz.

Repo policies:
When you are added as a collaborator, a folder will be created for you in the 
root of the repository.  Use that to organize and post your projects.  Projects 
in this repo are open for the other collaborators to contribute unless you say 
otherwise in the README for a particular project.  Any references to Leonardo
DiCrapio, Peter Jackson, or how "the old Battlestar Galactica was soooo much 
better than the new one (STARBUX IS A DUDE LOLWTF)" in commit messages, wiki 
contributions, pull requests, or comments will result in a permaban.
